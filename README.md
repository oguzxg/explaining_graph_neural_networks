# Explaining Graph Neural Networks Predictions
Explainability in Machine Learning Models is an important topic. 
Unlike simpler models like linear regression or decision trees, Graph Neural Network's (GNN) black-box nature raises questions about how they arrive at
their predictions and what factors influence their decision-making.
The black-box nature of GNNs raises critical questions about interpretability.
How does a GNN arrive at a particular prediction? Which specific nodes or
edges in the graph hold the most influence over the decision? What are the
most relevant features that inform the GNNs decision-making process? These
questions highlight the need for interpretability techniques that can uncover the
underlying mechanisms of GNNs and provide transparent explanations for their
predictions.
Explaining the predictions of a Graph Neural Network is a crucial task for
several reasons. First, interpretability is vital in many real-world applications,
especially those with high stakes, such as healthcare, finance and law enforcement, where decision-making processes need to be transparent and justifiable.
Second, providing explanations can enhance user trust and acceptance of GNNbased systems, allowing users to understand and verify the modelâ€™s reasoning
behind its predictions. Lastly, explanations can help identify potential biases,
limitations, or vulnerabilities in the model, driving improvements and reducing
potential risks.
